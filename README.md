# Image-To-ASCII
Image to ASCII text converter

Requires opencv and PIL

Simple script that prompts for a directory to an image and converts it to ASCII. (Not entirely robust or optimized, just a fun script. May expand later to fix those issues).
PNG and TXT files will extract into the same directory the file is run in.
Program will not work if you do not have the courbd.ttf file in the same directory.
(Also may not work if ran on desktop due to directory access restriction, but that has not been tested.)
